# Test Simulations

This directory contains test simulation results and work-in-progress simulations.

## Contents

- **RCS_Sphere/**: Results from radar cross section sphere simulations
- **coherent_backscatter/**: Coherent backscatter analysis simulations
- **target_testing/**: Test simulations for various target geometries
- **clipboard.txt**: Code snippets and notes for dump configurations

## Purpose

This directory serves as:
- A workspace for testing new simulation setups
- Storage for simulation results during development
- A collection of reference simulations

## Note

The files in this directory are typically simulation outputs and test results. They are useful for:
- Verifying simulation correctness
- Comparing results across parameter changes
- Debugging simulation issues

For production simulations, results are usually saved to `/tmp/` or other temporary directories as specified in the example scripts.

## Simulation Notes

### sim_notes.md

Contains detailed notes about specific simulation runs, parameters used, and observations. Check subdirectories for simulation-specific documentation.
