## Contents

- **context_intro.md**: Introduction and overview of the documentation
- **doc_dumps/**: API documentation dumps for openEMS and CSXCAD
- **doc_generation/**: Scripts or tools for generating documentation

## Usage

These files are primarily for AI tools and developers who want to understand the full API surface of:
- openEMS Python bindings
- CSXCAD Python bindings

## Note

This documentation is supplementary and not required for running simulations. For official documentation, please refer to:
